        <p>Hello! My name is Konrad de Ruyter and I am from Ventura County, California in the United States of America.
            I am 26 years old as of September 2025, and this is my first semester of school following my full-time
            mission
            service for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My hobbies include reading, drawing, writing
            stories, singing, music production, and blacksmithing. I have a background in graphic design and hope to use
            this course to further my
            skills in web design and programming. I have several years of experience programming with HTML, as well as
            some experience with Javascript and Python, but I am fairly new to CSS, so I am excited to learn more about
            how to design effective layouts and the correct way to organize code and content for a webpage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my website!</p>

        <p>California is a state in the Western United States that lies on the Pacific Coast. It borders Oregon to the
            north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja
            California to the south. California has the largest population and economy of any U.S. state, and is also
            considered one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world. California is the home of
            many modern industries, from movies to microchips, and is also famous for its beautiful weather and
            extensive coastline.</p>
