        <p>California is a state in the Western United States that lies on the Pacific Coast. It borders Oregon to the
            north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja
            California to the south. California has the largest population and economy of any U.S. state, and is also
            considered one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world. California is the home of
            many modern industries, from movies to microchips, and is also famous for its beautiful weather and
            extensive coastline.</p>
